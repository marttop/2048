# 2048

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game in C++ using the Raylib game library. The game is played on a 4x4 grid and the objective is to combine tiles with the same number to reach the tile with the value of 2048.

## Build
### Linux - Debian
- Install clang:  
  - ```wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh```  
  - ```chmod +x llvm.sh```  
  - ```sudo ./llvm.sh <version number>```  
- Run ```sudo apt install g++``` (for GNU compiler) or ```sudo apt install clang``` (for clang compiler)
- [Install raylib on linux](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux)
- Run ```sudo apt install cmake```
- Run ```sudo apt install ninja-build```

### Macos

- Clang should come with Xcode
- Run ```brew install raylib```
- Run ```brew install ninja```
- Run ```brew install cmake```

Clone the submodules
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build the dependencies
```bash
./build_submodules.sh
```

Build the project
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Ninja" ..
cmake --build . --target all
```

## Troubleshooting

If you ever run to something similar during execution

```bash

Run this command **after replacing the placeholder with yout path**

```bash

```

## Logging

By default, the `LOGGING` option is set to `ON` in the CMake build. This enables logging throughout the game code, which can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting.

If you wish to disable logging, you can set the `LOGGING` option to `OFF` when running CMake. For example, if you're using the command line, inside your build folder you can run:  
```
cmake -G "Ninja" -DLOGGING=OFF .
```

Alternatively, if you're using an IDE such as Visual Studio or CLion, you can configure the `LOGGING` option in the CMake settings.

Note that disabling logging can improve the performance of the game, but may make it more difficult to diagnose issues if they arise. It's recommended to leave logging enabled during development and testing, and disable it only for production builds.
